        <h3>Correlations Between Health Risks and Income</h3>
          <p> In relation to poverty and household income, It is to be noted that the charts display positive correlations between risk factors obesity and smoking.
              Further, There may be obvious indication, based on the trend, that less affluent and poorer states have higher obesity rates and greater tendencies of smoking. 
              Also, it appears as if that states with higher economic opportunities not only had higher rates of healthcare coverage, but lower obesity and smoking rates.
              The presence of the outliers can be an indication that the trends may need further study or analysis. An example of such outliers can be viewed in North Dakota and Iowa.</p>

          <h3>Correlations Between Health Risks and Age</h3>
          <p>In regards to health risks and age, the correlations are not really clear so to allow an in depth examination. However, tt appears as if that the median ages in most of the states are between 
             35-39 years old. Because of this agglomeration, it is difficult to properly visualize the data. Nevertheless, we were able to identify some degrees of correlations between higher median age 
             and higher healthcare coverage, lower median age and lower smoking rates, and even lower median age and lower obesity rates.</p>
